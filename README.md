# PlugwisePy

### Notice
Since i no longer own any plugwise devices, i stopped working on this codebase.
Feel free to use it as you like

## Goal
The goal of this script is rather simple
parse data read from (local network) adam (hub) and obtain thermostat values that are required
push the temperature and setpoint to domoticz first

## ToDo
Update and make sure that data can be sent back (setpoint) and more information is to be used

## Information
Obtained information with help of others from gathering.tweakers.net and from http://domoticx.com/plugwise-stretch-2-0-links-en-bestanden/
