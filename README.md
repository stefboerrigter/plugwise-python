# PlugwisePy

##Goal
The goal of this script is rather simple
parse data read from (local network) adam (hub) and obtain thermostat values that are required
push the temperature and setpoint to domoticz first

## ToDo
Update and make sure that data can be sent back (setpoint) and more information is to be used
